# Hi! I'm Austin Liu!

I'm currently a student majoring in computer science at Duke University.

I'm original from the San Francisco Bay Area, but I've also previously lived in Nanjing, China. 我也会说中文！

Aside from my research interests, I have a strong technical background in Python, Java, C, HTML/CSS, PyTorch, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. I have additional experience with Docker, Flutter, the Wolfram Language, JavaScript, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Pillow, Bash, and LaTeX.

Some of my previous work includes organizing [Los Altos Hacks](https://www.losaltoshacks.com/), teaching with [Silicon Valley Youth](https://www.siliconvalleyyouth.com/) and [StreetCode Academy](https://streetcode.org/), and [conducting research](/research).

In my free time, I enjoy traveling the world, running, and reading (mostly history and SFF).
