# Hi! I'm Austin Liu!

I'm currently a senior at Los Altos High School passionate about data analysis and machine learning.

I've previously lived in Nanjing, China and neighboring Mountain View, California. 我也会说中文！

Aside from my research interests, I have a strong technical background in Python, Java, HTML/CSS, PyTorch, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. I have additional experience with Docker, Flutter, C, the Wolfram Language, JavaScript, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Pillow, Bash, and LaTeX.

Some of my endeavors include organizing [Los Altos Hacks](https://www.losaltoshacks.com/), teaching with [Silicon Valley Youth](https://www.siliconvalleyyouth.com/) and [StreetCode Academy](https://streetcode.org/), and [conducting research](/research) on pressing issues.

**I'm always looking for new opportunities! Please reach out using [my contact form](/contact).**

You can also take a look at some of my hobbies like [cooking](/cooking) or [photography](/photography).
