Welcome to my website! I'm currently a senior at Los Altos High School interested in data science and machine learning and passionate about solving problems. I've previously lived in neighboring Mountain View, California and Nanjing, China. I'm proficient in Python, Java, HTML/CSS, PyTorch, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. I have additional experience with Flutter, C, the Wolfram Language, JavaScript, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Pillow, Bash, and LaTeX.

我也会说中文！

When I'm not studying or working on organizing [Los Altos Hacks](https://www.losaltoshacks.com/), you can find me exploring new places or digging into a new book. I also love to teach and inspire people, and I've worked with [Silicon Valley Youth](https://www.siliconvalleyyouth.com/) and [StreetCode Academy](https://streetcode.org/) for over four years teaching Python to K-12 students. If you're looking for an detail-oriented, experienced researcher to join your team, please reach out using [my contact form](/contact).

You can take a look at some of the research I've done on the [research page to the left](/research) or some of my hobbies like [cooking](/cooking) or [photography](/photography).
